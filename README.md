## Description

**Playlistr** is an app for live, group music listening on Spotify. 

Build a queue of songs with friends, listen to the music together, and control the music for the entire room - all in real-time.

Playlistr is built with React and socket.io to give users the real-time ability to add tracks to a shared queue and to play, pause, & skip to the next track.

After signing in with your Spotify Premium account, you can create a room to listen to music with friends. You can queue up one of your Spotify playlists, or search Spotify & add new tracks for the entire room. Once your friends join, everyone can add tracks to a shared queue and listen to the same songs. You and your friends can play, pause, or skip to the next song for everyone in the room - all in real-time.

## Join Playlistr

To participate, sign in with your Spotify Premium account, and check out Playlistr here: 

https://playlistr-io.herokuapp.com

You can create a room and queue up songs from one of your Spotify playlists. You can then use Playlistr to control the music while listening on Spotify. 

Invite friends to your room with the room code to listen together and see the real-time magic happen.

## Future Enhancements

It was important for us to develop MVP features, especially, the real-time listening and control of music. After having developed this, we hope to develop some additional features including:
